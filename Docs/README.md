# Documentation for PuffyHub

## Preparations

SwiftUI offers a straightforward method for previewing views. Given the nature of PuffyHub, we utilize real API requests to fetch data during these previews.

To proceed, please duplicate the file `PuffyHub/Debug/AppSettingsExample.swift` and rename it to `PuffyHub/Debug/AppSettingsPreview.swift`. Ensure you populate this new file with your instance URL and token before initiating the preview.
