# Documentation of PuffyHub

## Preparations

SwiftUI provided a simple way to preview views.
And considering the attribute of PuffyHub, we use real API request to get data during preview.

So, please copy `PuffyHub/Debug/AppSettingsExample.swift` to `PuffyHub/Debug/AppSettingsPreview.swift`, fill the instance URL and token before previewing.
